# DexterIK
A ROS package to perform Inverse Kinematics on Haddington Dynamic's Dexter robot

## Status
This is a work in progress. Basic control seems to work right now, but the urdf needs tuning so the IK works correctly, and some networking issues need to be resolved.

Work will continue when I regain access to a Dexter robot.

July 20, 2022:
- So Covid happened and I never got access to the robot :(
- I hope what is here can one day be helpful to somebody :)
